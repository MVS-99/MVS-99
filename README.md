# Hello, I'm Manuel üëã

I'm an engineer with a focus on Industry 4.0, leveraging a diverse skill set that includes Data Engineering, AI, DevOps, and Cybersecurity. I've had the opportunity to apply and hone these skills during my internships at Satec and SIA Group, where I worked on projects involving data flow design, system configuration, identity management, and cybersecurity compliance.

I have a solid academic background, with a Master's degree in Connected Industry 4.0 and a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Automation Engineering from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. I also had the privilege to study Applied Industrial Electronics at Aalborg University during my Erasmus program.

In terms of technical skills, I'm proficient in a variety of areas:

- **Data Management**: Experience with various databases and data flow design, understanding the importance of data integrity and availability.
- **DevOps**: Familiar with system configuration and containerization, emphasizing the importance of CI/CD in modern software development.
- **Cybersecurity**: Knowledgeable in cybersecurity compliance and penetration testing, understanding the critical role of security in all aspects of technology.
- **Web Development**: Proficient in creating dynamic and responsive web applications, with a focus on both front-end and back-end development.
- **IoT and Big Data Analytics**: Experienced in handling and analyzing large datasets, and integrating IoT devices for data collection and automation.
- **AR/VR and Robotics**: Interest in exploring the potential of AR/VR technologies and collaborative robotics in Industry 4.0.
- **Embedded Systems**: Expertise in microprocessors and embedded systems, with the ability to apply knowledge and understanding to identify, formulate and solve engineering problems, develop and realise designs, program microcontroller peripherals, and combine theory and practice to solve problems of microprocessor-based digital systems.

I've also completed a Bachelor's thesis titled 'Desarrollo y Evaluaci√≥n de una Aplicaci√≥n Web para Fotogrametr√≠a en Smartphones: un Enfoque Integral para la Creaci√≥n de Modelos 3D', which received a score of 9.4/10. Currently, I'm working on my Master's thesis, 'Analysis and synthesis of data related to Industry 4.0'.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see the projects I've worked on, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas!
